# Sparse-view-AET
The NSIRE package performs iterative sampling from the data distribution of atomic potential using a diffusion model until atomic tomogram that subject to the ADF-STEM projection constraints are obtained, enabling high accuracy (<20pm RMSD and ~0.1 R1 factor error) three-dimensional atomic structure reconstruction under sparse-view (10 to 20 projections), assists AET reconstruction of irradiated sensitive samples and ultra-small nanoparticles
